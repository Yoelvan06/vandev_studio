  <h2>Lonely: a slice of life point and click game</h2>
    <p>
      to think about me being in college now is surprising. I never though i could make it this far. I'm in college now, studying about computer science. I'm not sure what i'm gonna do after this, but i'm sure that i'm gonna make a lot more games. Currently i'm studying java(Not just javascript) but THE Java programming language too. Hope i survive. 
      Studying programming after all of the max2d drama is something else(it's on my youtube video) but it opens up possibility for me to explore more about other game engines. I collected more times to learn previous game engines i used once before. Including Rpg maker and renpy(we studied python in college too). But nothing compares coming back to
      Adventure game studio, my all time favourite game engine. My love to old point and click flash games is still intact. Which is what encourage me to start making a new point and click game again! This time, it has to be longer
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

      You heard that right. A new point and click game made by me that's longer. Although i'm still not sure how long it's going to be. But trust me this time, i put more effort on this than from my older point and click games. I broke a lot of promises before, it is best to stick to the truth for this time, my drawing still hasn't improved,
      so the silly cartoon artstyle will remain the same like my previous max2d games, i'll try to make it up with a good writing(I'm not a good writer either). My main goal for this game is ..just go crazy with it, it's a learning oppurtunity too. The story of the game "Lonely" is gonna be inspired by my real life experience(Not everything but most emotional aspect that occur during the story)

  <h2>New Games are pubblished</h2>
    <p>
      Rockpaperscissors is a cancelled project, but my hardwork still worth a try. So i should let you try it. The game is released and now playable for free. Go check it out <a href="https://yoelvan06.itch.io/baguntas-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The empty factory is yours, start your business now on the new <a href="https://yoelvan06.itch.io/redball-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redball factory</a>
    </p>
  
  <h2>Get ready for the battle</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="img/lmCRzH.png" alt="A screenshot of baguntas" style="float: right; padding: 10px; width: 400px;">
      Rock paper scissors is a really fun minigame that we do with a lot of people. You know how to play it, you know how to win it. But don't you think its a little bit too boring when you do it so many times.
      Not anymore, i'm going to challange you to play baguntas battle. baguntas is the weird name that i pick, sorry for that. Baguntas is a game about playing rock paper scissors but with style. Here you have over 20 characters and stages that ready to be challanged for fight.
      However, they're not doing any different neither the gameplay. They're just there standing there and doing exactly nothing, trying to be honest here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do i call it baguntas? If you translate Rock paper scissors to indonesia, its called "Batu gunting kertas" Combine all the words and you get yourself Baguntas.
      The main point is, You have yourself a rock paper scissors fighting game.
    </p>


  <h2>1k subs</h2>
    <p>
      After 3 years of hardwork, i can finally reach 1k subscribers on my youtube channel. I can't do any of this without you guys, thank you so much! I will do a livestream if we could reach 10k subscribers, i promise. I'm not sure what my next target is.
      I think my next target is to monetize my channel, hopefully i can reach that. Thanks again btw, this is awesome
    </p>

  <h2>New challanges</h2>
    <p> 
      The new game looks very awesome, I'm really excited to show it to you guys.
      I'm not just making one huge game, but 2 games are coming soon to the platform. I will release the trailer soon so you don't miss any information. About the gameplay, i can't spoil too much cause i don't
      wanna ruin the surprise. However, i can show you a bunch of features that will be used for the upcoming games on my facebook account
    </p>

  <h2>Factory where everything began</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="img/Ur0Z17.png" alt="Balls factory image" style="float: left; padding: 10px; width: 400px;">
      Remember redball adventure? Yes, i made a game about the beginning on how everything happen. It start from zero where everything is normal, yet untill YOU as the player start a business and destroy everything.
      Sounds like too much right? Well that's just an opening. The actual gameplay is littelary just a simulation business game. With 10$ you can change a future. Its your choice to continue or just move out.
      I will of course put a bunch of mystery that you can solve but again, its up to you. Its okay to not solve the mystery, sometime it is better to escape from a mistake that you made.
      So this game is in the same universe and timeline as redball adventure game.
    </p>
